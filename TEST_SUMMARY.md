## Coverage Details

### 100% Coverage
- `bend/__init__.py` (3/3 statements)

### 99% Coverage
- `bend/core.py` (172/173 statements)
  - Missing: Line 198 (to_string() call in __repr__, called but not detected)

### 79% Coverage
- `bend/cli.py` (23/29 statements)
  - Missing: Lines 42, 50, 79-81, 85
  - These are interactive REPL helper functions and start_ipython/code.interact calls
  - Difficult to test in automated environment
  - Verified manually via REPL testing

## Verified Functionality

All features described in README work as documented:

### Core Operations
- ✓ Load CSV from file, URL, or Google Sheets
- ✓ Skip rows on import (--skip-rows N)
- ✓ Extend with computed columns
- ✓ Transform to reshape data
- ✓ Filter to subset rows
- ✓ Sort by columns (ascending/descending)
- ✓ Head to limit results
- ✓ Groupby with custom aggregations
- ✓ Hide/show columns for display
- ✓ Native printability (print(q))
- ✓ Iteration support (for row in q)
- ✓ Export to CSV (dump)

### Advanced Features
- ✓ Change tracking and history
- ✓ Refresh (re-apply changes to base)
- ✓ Reload (fetch new data, re-apply changes)
- ✓ Rebase (flatten change history)
- ✓ Column validation on reload
- ✓ Method chaining
- ✓ Dot-accessible row attributes

### Aggregations
- ✓ sum(), mean(), median()
- ✓ min(), max()
- ✓ count()
- ✓ std(), var()
- ✓ unique(), nunique()

### Data Quality
- ✓ Null handling in filters
- ✓ Exception handling in operations
